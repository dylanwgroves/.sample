The allegation is that the station conducted an interview with ed. Lema and used the opportunity to insult RC. Police conducted a search and listened to records of the period and interrogated some of the staff for about three hours.

and the communications commission, to provide for the amendment. The station returned

It was established by Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) in early 1990s. UPL publishes a Kiswahili daily tablod UHURU and two other weekly newspapers MZALENDO and BURUDANI which is for entertainment.

The history of UHURU Publications Limited dates back to April 1962 when Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) established Mwananchi Printing and Publishing Company whose Board of Directors was filled up with ministers, other politicians and party cadres. In 1966, on recommendation from the government, TANU agreed to split its Mwananchi Printing and Publishing Company into two companies. Printing was put under te newly formed National Printing Company (Kiwanda cha Taifa cha Uchapaji –KIUT) that was placed under the National Development Corporation (NDC) while publishing was left with the reconstructed Mwananchi Publishing Company (1966) Limited. However, Mwananchi Publishing Company (1966) Ltd was later renamed Shirika la Magazeti ya Chama which in early 1990s was renamed UHURU Publications Limited. UPL aquired a web-offset press in 1995 and operated it under a subsidiary company named Modern Newspapers Printers, making UHURU the first local Kiswahili newspaper to print in colour on its own press.

Following the changes that took place in 1966, Benjamin William Mkapa, former Managing Editor of TANU who owned The Nationalist newspaper and later became the third phase President of the United Republic of Tanzania, took over as Managing Editor of the party newspapers. The first Managing Editor was Roland Mwanjisi followed by Joel Mgogo.

The Managing Editor is appointed by the Central Committee of CCM on recommendation from the Board of UPL. Currently, UPL has no Board after its members resigned in September 2016 following the visit of CCM Chairman and President of the United Republic of Tanzania, Dr. John Pombe Magufuli, to UPL and employees told him about mismanagement and maladministration prevailing in UPL.",CCM,CCM,Yes,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radio Mbiu is a joint product of the Friends of Radio Maria Tanzania and Bukoba State. It is a radio owned by AMANI BROADCASTING LIMITED which was registered with Brela on 01/04/2014. Amani Broadcasting Limited took over the responsibility of establishing Radio Mbiu and on 07/07/2014 Radio Mbiu was officially registered as a commercial radio and set up its offices in Bunena area in Bukoba Municipality in Kagera Region.

Radio Mbiu received a permit to build a radio station (construction permit CP) from TCRA on 01/09/2016 numbered CP. No. BA 149/358/012/31 and received the first frequency 88.9 fm which was later changed due to the fact that the frequencies had already been given to another radio. So the frequencies were changed to 104.9 fm. On 13/04/2018 it was inspected by TCRA and allowed to start one month trial which ended on 12/05/2018. On 13/05/2018 Radio Trump with the slogan 'VOICE OF COMFORT' was officially allowed to start the episodes. Radio Mbiu has been granted a District License which according to the new TCRA law is allowed to have three frequencies namely 104.9 fm which is for Kagera region and two more which can be closed in any other two regions. The range must be valid within one year of obtaining the license. The radio leadership will decide which regions radio will expand to after Kagera. But there is a strong possibility of regions bordering the Kagera region. Others will follow after changing the license status from District to Regional License.
