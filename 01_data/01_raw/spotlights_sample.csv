The sitution gets worse in the rainy seasonbecause the prices for the boda boda are high and they will not take you alll the way to the hospital, so you have to walk. The journalist did too many interviews with the local villagers.

Mputeni Village
Mijelejele Ward
Masasi District
Mtwara Region.

Problem
They have no Primary or Secondary School from the village to begin with and it is a long village from the Socialist Village era.

The children walk 6 km to the neighboring village to follow the school.

To get to school there they have to cross two big rivers where during the rainy season the rivers are full of water the children are unable to cross (they stay home they do not go to school they miss lessons).

Effect
1. Children have been very absent (do not go to school as required).

2. Many villagers are illiterate due to failure to attend school properly.

3. So far one child has lost his life (died) after drowning in a river on his way to school.

Government
1. Fulfill its responsibility by building schools in the village because the villagers are ready to dedicate their work even by contributing the amount of money as well. To support the Government to achieve the construction of schools. They have already provided more than 9 hectares of land for school construction, but they are unable to start construction because they are completing the construction of clinics (by the power of the people) so they cannot achieve two projects together.

2. Government As it continues to plan for the construction of a school in Mputeni village, they should build a road leading to the neighboring village where there is a school (river to put a bridge) so that children can continue to study in the neighboring village while waiting to complete the construction of the school.

This DC and DED I went to avoid me as two days I miss their Cooperation (they do not want to talk about anything), But Through the Councilor has explained what has been discussed in the Council

Journalist went to ask Mwenyekiti about the issue, And he said from 2012 to now, many people have been attached and killed by the crocodiles. before, the government saw this issue and they sent TANAPA police to reduce the number of crocodiles in Rubana river and Lake victoria. They have been reporting this to the authorities but nothing has been done. Diwani said, Crocodiles are too many and now they come close to peoples residents. The solution should be getting water infrastructure to the Nyatwali people so that they dont go to the rivers and lakes to fetch water. But this wont somlve much, because people have to take theur livestock to drink water, there are fishermen, So the great solution shoud be to reduce the number of crocodiles by killing them. Our Journalist went to the District office and talked to The wild animals officer, He admited to the issue, sating there have been reports of such cases. But For now people should stay away from the places where attacks have happened before. And for the people who were attacked, we have a system to compernsate them. And we are planing to sent our police from TANAPA (Tanzania national parks authority) to kill and sometimes move the crocs who have shifted to the peoples residence. Also they have a depertment for educating people how to live/behave when they meet the wild animals like elephants, Lions and Crocs.

And they said they started the process of bulding the clinic in 2017, since then they have only reached the basement/Baseline stage. They have contributed money to the clinic but they wonder where the funds went.  We asted the mwenyekiti about this, He said, at first, people from municipal came to review the project, and said the area of construction is small it should be atleast an acre. and they bought the land from the neighbours. Now they have bought rocks for construction and they dont have transportation to the site, they want municipat car to come and collect building materials up to the site. Diwani acknowleded the issue and he promised to complete the clinic by next year, he was asked if this is dowable, he said, they will buld 80% and district will do the remaining 20%. WEO said that contributions if they are made, the money becomes the governments, but if the purpose of money changes, then it becomes and issue. DED said government has its procedures, if the building reaches the certain point then we will help. Then we set a side a budget to finish the clinic, The village has to tell us their priorities.

Citizens are complaining about the water crisis as it leads to quarrels among themselves in the areas of drawing water, the family economy is declining due to the inability to focus more on income activities, even students are facing the challenge of late schooling and missing some subjects due to searching water for a long time. The people use water from local wells and there are two taps in the whole village whereby their village is large, so it is difficult for some neighborhoods to get the service easily due to the distance of about 12 KM. These local wells were dug by the people themselves, the government has never dug a well in the village. The water from these wells is not healthy and if not boiled it can also lead to diseases such as typhoid, schistosomiasis, UTI, etc. The villagers have reported this problem to the leaders during the village meetings but no action has been taken by the officials although they say they are following up. This water scarcity in the village is affecting more women as they spend a lot of time looking for water and are unable to do other economic activities and look after the family. There are several ways in which citizens can free themselves from this torment, including; in the rainy season they protect the water with tin through the roofs of houses for family use, this is a little better than in the dry season when the water shortage is very high; attempting to create shallow water in wells where it is drilled up to 10+ meters deep where it is dangerous in the drainage system; there has been a garbage dump nearby in the village and still the villagers are drinking water from the sewage system which is the most dangerous. It is also said that there was support from donors to dig four wells which are also not enough to meet the needs of about 3,000 people in Ihanga village. However our journalist spoke to a village council member of the Ihanga village government and admitted to having a water challenge in their village; initially there was a well that was supplying water then it stopped completely providing water later, fortunately they got help from sponsors (Islamic institution) who dug shallow wells, bywhich due to the village situation the wells do not meet the needs as Ihanga village is very large and these wells supply water only temporarily, especially during the rainy season, so the wells ceased to supply water after that rainy season. Currently there are no more than two fortifications that provide water in this village. There are also wells in every ward where these wells do not work properly as top officials tend to focus mainly on people in urban areas and fail to reach the rural population. Village government officials claim to have tackled this challenge by finding various stakeholders and successfully bringing in sponsors and reviving a dead well that is still working properly, they also encouraged the people to dig local wells of 3-5 meters to avoid going too far in search of water. The chairman of Ihanga village said that the village has 4 subvillages, and water nuisance exists in all neighborhoods but the biggest water shortage is in 2 subvillages where there are no wells at all. This water challenge has been discussed at village meetings and was reported to the councilors' meeting whereby the answers given are unsatisfactory as they do not match the reality of the matter. They have also made efforts to drill shallow wells which is also a challenge as they provide water seasonal. So the Chairman and the villagers of Ihanga are asking the government to hear their cries. The councilor was interviewed by our journalist and admitted to being aware of the Ihanga water challenge; they made an effort to talk to the government at council meetings on the issue, but the solution takes time due to the budget problem for this year until the next period; also to get help to dig short wells from an Islamic institution but they have been unproductive meaning they are short. So this village needs deep wells to be dug by truck. The councilor urges Ihanga villagers not to give up in urging leaders to follow up and fight for a solution to access clean and safe water.",,,,,,,CCM,CCM ,49.80%,52.60%,,,,,,4022,2055,1967,940,,"-6.790635068069331, 37.66101363428753","-8.095432099616547, 36.59858141204586"

The villagers claim that they have no water at all and rely on rainwater, which also does not satisfy their needs because it is seasonal. They have to walk 15 KM from the village to reach the pool water; where the biggest victims on the issue are women and girls whereby they spend many hours searching for water until midnight, a situation that causes economic instability, broken marriages and moral erosion. There has been a supply of tap water in the village but the water does not flow for a long time, that is, for almost a month water may not flow from the pipes. Many residents of Kabuku areas have developed a rainwater harvesting system which also costs them a lot of money to build the system. The high cost for building the system makes it difficult for poor families not able to create a harvest system and lead them to asking for water from the families that have developed such systems. It has been reported that Kabuku County has had a lot of water infrastructure but there is still a serious shortage of water, and that is because many tap are broken and pipes are burst. An alternative to dealing with water scarcity is to buy water which is also very expensive; whereas in the village of Majani Mapana the water is sold for 500TSH instead of the government guide price which is 100TSH.

Chairperson reported that residents of this village are still facing the challenge of the lack of clinics. The situation causes maternal maternal to give birth along the way without care of health workers; And some citizens lose life before they get the service due to the distance of health centers. The villagers claim that their village does not have a health clinic since the health facilities are very far away to deal with pregnant women to give birth along a way to receive health care. It has been reported to have a remote pharmacy that has been as an alternative to access to a close health care whereby a sick person is given medication except for a dangerous disease as high BP whereby the patient should be given medication if shows prescriptions from the Doctor. Citizens have reported this challenge to the leaders in the village meetings, and there have been an area that is ready for the construction of the clinic but no other steps were done. Working up and leaders tell them that this issue is being processed. Therefore, citizens ask the government through its leaders including the Madingati ward councilor to help them move the service of the clinic around them as mothers are the main victims for lack of health care. In addition, our journalist managed to interview the ward councilor who admitted to know the challenge of lack of health care in his ward. He has said that there have been strategies planned with the village leaders of Usagari on what should be done in solving the challenge, and the current goal is to ensure from the harvest season until the end of 2021 the clinic to be completed; He added that as the Chairman of the Nzega District Committee encourages the people to establish the possibility of the Council to complete the clinic building of Usagari. The councilor added, the challenge of the clinic in Usagari village has been reported to the Council and explained to the DMO, but due to the procedure that is very rarely the Council will receive money to start the building and finish, so, it is a protocal to start the construction at the village level first to a point where the Council will continue and complete. Previously, the citizens were reluctants to contributions since they could not evident success in their contributions; So, extra effort has been used to educate and persuade citizens to contribute money and follow up if the money really solves a problem. And these contributions are expecting to be suggested at a period of harvesting so that may not burden their responsibilities. So, until the end of the year the clinics will be completed. Our journalist has spoken to the DMO of Nzega and explaining that there are about 158 ​​villages in the Nzega Council where there is a shortage of clinics in some of these villages; And the size of the village varies, as there are other small village which also seem difficulty to reach and health services are not available closely. She acknowledges the challenge of mothers giving birth along the way with no guidance, although no evidence on deaths of people from the challenge. Nevertheless, they have been insisting in each village to establish the construction of the clinic until the level of lentar in accordance with the existing procedures, where the government through the Council will help the completion of the construction, as well as bringing health workers and medicine. They expect to earn 200Mil TSH from the budget to complete the construction of three clinics; Councils are also separately saving domestic revenue funds in order to help complete the clinic that has reached the steps to be handed over to the Council to finish the construction. However, the Council has not set aside any money for the construction Usagari Clinic as they are still in low steps of completing the construction, so he urges the Usagari villagers to contribute and volunteer to lift the construsction at least reach the point of lenta then the Council will assist the rest.",,,,,,,CCM,CCM,64.40%,65.30%,,,,,,,,,,1,"-5.028142942311789, 32.8180228962797","-4.886096871070618, 32.50951963626708"

Sopa villagers are challenged by health workers as well as medical equipment at their village clinic. It has been reported that the existing clinic in Sopa has been given the status of a health facility that still does not meet that status. Citizens claim that there is no enough medicine in this Sopa health center, although they pay 30,000TSH; also there are not enough attendants and those present are taking turns. This health facility is said to be very far away, leading pregnant women to fail to arrive and eventually give birth on the way. So they are asking the government to help in improving the infrastructure and access to health workers and medical equipment in order to achieve the status of a health facility. Our Journalist spoke to the Chairman of Sopa village and acknowledged the challenge, adding that the people are very committed to contributing manpower as well as money in the construction of clinics. He added that in their village clinic there is a shortage of buildings. So he is asking the government to donate buildings to the clinic, as citizens are also ready to support the government in achieving that. Our Journalist also spoke to Sopa Councilor and acknowledged the challenge of shortage of medical equipment and staff at the clinic. He said that the clinic they are using has been built since 2007, and was built by the people, substandard and incomplete; medicines are also not enough and the nurse has to take them home as there is a challenge of drug theft due to poor infrastructure. He added that since becoming a Councilor they have made contributions to the villagers in building toilets etc. However, they have been requesting funds (30 Mil) from the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 financial budgets without success. He said they are still urging council officials to improve the health issue as the village clinic does not have a friendly environment and the health center is more than 20 KM away. And on the part of the staff he said there are a few but at least not as much challenge as in the case of infrastructure. Nevertheless, our journalist has spoken to the Kalambo District Commissioner and acknowledged awareness of the health challenges, but urged the people to follow the existing procedures in accessing health services in accordance with the existing policies in each village. He said, the health care policy shows that there are clinics in every village and health center in the county. Where currently the health facilities being built are of high quality and able to serve many people, so instead of building a health center in every ward it will now be built in divisions. So Sopa village has a dispensary where the services provided there are of the status of a dispensary, but if there is a need for additional health care then it is necessary to be referred to a health facility. So, the challenge there is infrastructure and not health care challenge.",,,,,,,CCM,CCM,55.5%%,53.30%,,,,,,2725,1323,1402,531,,"-7.960519700466374, 31.611196728799998","-8.445643250344, 31.51098999919027"

The manager claims that the distribution of electricity in the region has succeeded and still continue to exercise. In areas that have Network and ones that have no Network, we have done the assessment and add them to the Plan and asked for their budget whereby they expect to start supplying electricity from July this year. They urge the citizens of Rukwa not to worry as the goal of TANESCO is to reach services. So they should expect electrical projects to begin from July when the budget is issued. He has also told the people and their leaders to be free to reach TANESCO office for followups and electrical challenges.
